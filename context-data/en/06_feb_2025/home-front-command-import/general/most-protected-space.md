## Choosing the Most Protected Space
Even if you do not have a residential protected space, communal protected space or a shelter that is accessible within the time available to reach shelter, you can choose the stairwell or an inner room in the house as a protected space
We all know that our protected space is the safest place to be during a rocket or missile attack. This guide explains how the most protected space accessible in the time available to reach shelter, keeps us safe during a rocket or missile attack, and what what is the proper conduct in it.


## Choosing the protected space
When an alert is received, we must enter the protected space within the time available to reach shelter, and wait 10 minutes. This action can prevent serious injuries caused by rocket, missile, or fragment impact, and can even save our lives.
Therefore, it is essential to choose a protected space according to the guidelines, and to prepare it in advance.

Numerous past incidents have shown that following Home Front Command instructions to enter protected spaces has saved lives. Unfortunately, a few of those who didn’t have time or weren’t able to do so, were injured.

The Home Front Command guidelines enable everyone to choose a protected space according to the “most protected space” principle. Thus, even if you don’t have a residential protected space (Mamad), a communal protected space (Mamak), or a bomb shelter that is accessible within the time available to reach shelter, you can choose the stairwell or an inner room as a protected space.

### This is how the "most protected space" keeps us safe

A missile or rocket has several parts, including a warhead. When the warhead hits the ground, a wall, or any other object, it explodes. The explosion generates thousands of burning shrapnel pieces and a powerful blast that can injure us, depending on the magnitude of the explosion and our proximity to it.

When we stand exposed near the source of an explosion, for example, outdoors, on a balcony or by a window, we could be struck directly by high-velocity shrapnel. Additionally, the blast caused by the explosion can propel us, potentially causing severe internal injuries.

**Remember: To increase your safety, position yourself in the innermost part of the building, with as many block or concrete walls as possible between you and the explosion site to minimize the risk of shrapnel and blast impact.**

### The stairwell as a protected space

The stairwell can be chosen as a protected space, provided that it is internal (without windows, hatches and external walls), and that there is at least one floor (preferably two) above us, and one floor below us.

Note: make sure the stairwell is not blocked and the passageway is clear.

When receiving an alert - stay on the stairwell and not in the floor space. In a building with more than three floors, you must stay on a stairwell that has at least two floors above it, and in a three-story building, you must stay in the stairwell on the middle floor.

### How does an internal stairwell protect us?

The internal stairwell, constructed from reinforced concrete, is situated at the building's core and is surrounded by apartments, making it the structural backbone of the entire building. This provides it with greater durability and strength than the rest of the structure. Moreover, the concrete floor beneath us, the ceiling above us, and the presence of at least two walls surrounding us provide added layers of protection.

Upon receiving an alert, position yourself **on the stairwell** and not in the floor space. In a building with more than three floors, stay on a stairwell with at least two floors above it, and in a three-story building, stay on middle floor stairwell. Do not stand on the ground or upper floors as the concrete floors beneath and ceiling above provide protection, prevent shrapnel injury and slow down the blast.

### An inner room as a protected space

An inner room can be designated as the protected space, provided the room is situated within a concrete or block-constructed building. Ensure that the chosen room has minimal windows, openings, and external walls and is free of any ceramic tiles, porcelain and glass that could shatter. Alternatively, choose an inner hallway and securely close all doors and windows. Note: Kitchens, toilets and bathrooms cannot serve as protected spaces.

### How does an inner room provide protection?

The building’s innermost room is less exposed to blast and shrapnel because it is surrounded by other rooms and walls. The more we distance ourselves from the external environment, **the lower the risk of being hit by blast and shrapnel.**

Upon receiving an alert, position yourself close to an inner wall and sit below the window line and not facing a door for the following reasons:

1\. Standing near a closed window exposes us to shrapnel or blast injuries as the window might explode, even if we are a great distance (dozens of meters) from the explosion site.

2\. Shrapnel can penetrate an external wall. In addition, the blast may cause the wall to collapse or break, causing injuries from pieces of cement from the wall.

3\. Shrapnel and the force of the blast can penetrate the door.

In any case, being in a regular room, with block-constructed and concrete walls and a concrete ceiling is preferable to remaining outdoors, because the speed and force of the shrapnel and blast are lower. Nevertheless, it is essential to take action to limit the risk – **sit close to an inner wall, below the window line and not facing the door.**

### Outdoors – lie on the ground

• If you are in an open area outdoors and cannot enter a nearby building, lie on the ground and protect your head with your hands. [Here you can read why it’s important to lie down on the ground](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/articles/info/iron-swords/1105/).

• Note - even if you are inside a prefabricated structure without to a protected space accessible within the time available to reach shelter – leave the building, lie on the ground and protect your head with your hands for 10 minutes.

**Remember: these guidelines are always applicable, whether the explosion impacts the street, the wall of the building we are in, or even a nearby building.**
