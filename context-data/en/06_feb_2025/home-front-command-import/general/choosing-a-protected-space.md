## Choosing a Protected Space
 
This is how we choose the most protected space available, depending on the time we have available and the protection available in our environment.
 
Upon receiving an alert for a rocket and missile attack or infiltration of hostile aircraft, enter the protected space according to the [time available to you to reach shelter](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/articles/info/iron-swords/1103/), and wait inside for 10 minutes. This can save lifea and prevent serious injuries.

[**For behavior guidelines when receiving an alert**](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/life-saving-guidelines/rocket-and-missile-attacks/)

It is essential to choose “the most protected space possible”, based on the protection available and the ability to [reach it in time](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/articles/info/iron-swords/1103/). To check the time available to reach shelter in your area, enter the name of your location into the box on the homepage. 

### The order of priority for choosing a protected space:

**1.** **The residential protected room (MAMAD) or communal protected space (MAMAK) are the preferred option.**When receiving an alarm, close the door tightly and turn the handle 90 degrees, and ensure that the outer steel window and the inner glass window are closed (if a double-wing glass window is installed - the wings must be removed in advance and placed outside the room until the emergency is over).**2.** Shelters:

**An apartment building shelter** – provided it can be reached within the time to reach shelter and in addition, if it can be reached by an internal stairway i.e. windowless stairway. **A public shelter (miklat)** – provided that it can be reached within the time available to reach shelter.

**3\. Internal stairwell**

You can choose the staircase (without windows and external walls) to serve as a protected space and to be located in its center - neither on the top floor nor the bottom floor. You should stay on the staircase and not in the floor space. It is important to ensure that the stairwells are free of equipment that may interfere with passage.**How does an internal stairwell protect us from injury?** An internal stairwell is surrounded by the walls of the apartments that surround it, is made of cast concrete, and is the mainstay of the building. Therefore, it is stable, durable and has been proven many times to be a lifesaver.

**4\. An inner room -** if there are no residential protected rooms, floor protected spaces, a public shelter or an internal stairwell, choose an inner room with as few external walls, windows and openings as possible. Do not choose kitchens, bathrooms or toilets and keep away from ceramics, porcelain and glass that might shatter. When receiving an alert, sit in an inner corner, below the window line and not facing the door.

### The following cannot be used as protected spaces

Kitchens, toilets and bathrooms cannot be used as protected spaces; stay away from ceramics, porcelains and glass that may shatter.

### Important Highlights

• Stay away from the building entrance area because of the danger of rocket fragments and blast waves due to impact near buildings.

The exterior steel window and interior glass window in the emergency room must be closed and locked until the emergency is over. If a sliding glass window (double-leaf) is installed, it must be removed and taken outside the protected room

• If there is no access to a protected room, an internal stairwell or an inner room, lie on the ground and protect your head with your hands. [Click here to understand how lying on the ground saves you.](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/articles/info/iron-swords/1105/) 

• If an alert is received while you are inside a prefabricated structure, leave the building and go into the protected space in the time available to reach shelter. If entering a protected space within [the time available to reach shelter](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/articles/info/iron-swords/1103/) is not possible, leave the building, lie on the ground and protect your head with the hands. 

• The protected space must be maintained in good condition, the route to it must be planned and practiced, and all passageways and stairwells must be clear of obstacles that may interfere with passage in order to avoid accidents, and the room should be equipped with [emergency equipment and communication methods](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/articles/info/preparing-protected-space/1201/).

• For a large portion of the population, the stairwell is the most protected space available. If possible, place chairs for elderly persons.

Remember: Choosing a protected space according to these guidelines significantly reduces the risk of injury from rockets and fragments, and can save lives.

## Selecting and preparing the protected space for people with disabilities

• The protected space should be selected according to the time available to reach shelter from the moment of receiving the alert. That is, if there is no protected room, and it is not possible to reach a shelter or an internal stairwell - an internal space with as few windows, openings and external walls as possible should be chosen.

• After we have chosen the protected space, we should practice reaching it from different places (for example, from the kitchen, the living room and the bedroom) to ensure that you reach it on time and safely.

• The routes leading to the protected space should be cleared of obstacles and objects that may interfere with movement, such as carpets, flower pots and chairs, and sofas and armchairs should be moved to allow a wide and safe passage. It is recommended to ask family members, friends or neighbors to perform these actions, if we cannot do them alone.

• Please note: Go to the protected room quickly and carefully. If we walk at a pace that is not typical for us, it is recommended to use any support available in the environment (wall, railing or mobility device).

• If there is difficulty with mobility (a person using a wheelchair or walker and bedridden) - move the bed to a protected room or an internal room and place it against an internal wall, below the window line and not in front of the door. Make sure that there are no shelves or objects that could fall above the bed.

• If there is difficulty moving from sitting on a sofa to a wheelchair in a short time - place the sofa against an internal wall, below the window line and not in front of the door.
