## How to choose a protected space?
The protected space is chosen according to our ability to reach it in [the time available to reach shelter](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/articles/info/iron-swords/1103/) and in accordance will the following order of priority: a Mamad/Mamak/Mamam (a residential protected room/floor protected space/ institutional protected space); A public shelter; An inner stairwell - with no windows or external openings; An inner room with a minimum number of exterior walls, windows and openings (even a corridor can be used as an inner room). Do not choose a toilet or bathroom and stay away from ceramic, porcelain and glass that might shatter. You should plan the way to reach the protected space in advance and clear it of obstacles and objects that may expropriate traffic and cause falls or injuries. In addition, do not stay at the entrance to the building due to the risk of shrapnel and blast, and it is important to leave the front door of the building open for the benefit of those staying outside.

## What is better, Mamad or shelter?
A residential protected room (MAMAD) is the best protected space as it is a designated room within your home, that is designed to provide a solution for emergency situations such as rocket and missile fire. The MAMAD has reinforced concrete ceiling and walls, that extend to the building's foundations, making it resistant and very strong. The MAMAD is the best protected space when an alert of rocket or missile fire is received, because it is inside the building and can be reached reasonably quickly. Also, because the MAMAD is an integral part of the home, and used daily, it is regularly maintained, so in the event it is needed, it is ready to use. The MAMAD also has a psychological advantage - in an emergency, the household members, and especially the children, stay in a familiar room and friendly environment that help reduce anxieties. The protected space must be chosen according to the time available to reach shelter.

## What is a standard protected space?
A standard protected space includes a residential protected room (Mamad), a floor protected space (Mamak), an institutional protected space (Mamam), or a shelter that is available depending on the time. A protective and any other structure is not a standard protected space.

## What can we do if we don’t have a shelter or a residential protected room (Mamad)?
If there is no Mamad or shelter in the building, choose an inner stairwell without exterior walls, windows and openings and sit on a staircase and not in the floor space, so there are at least 2 floors above you in a 3 story building - stay in the stairwell of the middle floor.
If there is no inner stairwell, choose an inner room (that is not a kitchen, a bathroom or a toilet) with as few external walls, windows and openings as possible and sit in an inner corner below the window line and not in front of the door.

Remember - anyone, anywhere in the country has the ability to defend themselves according to the Home Front Command guidelines.

## If the stairwell is used as a protected space, which floor should I stay on?
Only if there is no Mamad, Mamak, Mamam or shelter that can be reached within the time available to reach shelter, enter an inner staircase, without windows, openings and external walls. When receiving an alert, sit on a staircase and not in the floor space. In the building with more than three floors - you must stay in a staircase that has at least two floors above it. In a building with less than three floors - you must stay on the middle floor.
