Protecting your home from fire

Preparing in advance for fire, can save lives. The preparation includes installing a smoke detector and buying a fire extinguisher, which will allow you to put out the fire when it first breaks out, and practicing quick exit from the house. Instructions
 

A small fire in the house can easily lead to a fire trap, which will endanger your life. Advance preparation includes the possibility of extinguishing the fire immediately upon its outbreak using fire detection and extinguishing means, along with planning and practicing the correct actions during a fire. This way you can save yourself and your family members in the event of a fire, and prevent extensive damage to property.

[For life-saving guidelines during a fire](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/articles/fires-storms/fires/2900/).

The following are important emphases from National Fire and Rescue Authority, that makes it possible to prepare in advance for fires:

### Early detection - Installing a smoke detector

The ability to detect a fire as soon as it starts can save lives. This is done either by taking measures to extinguish the fire, or by fleeing the area where the fire broke out.

To make sure we can detect a fire as quickly as possible, it is important to install smoke detectors in our homes, which will alert if a fire breaks out.

This is especially important in cases where the fire breaks out when the household members are asleep. When we sleep, our sense of smell does not detect the smell of fire, and we may learn there is an actual fire too late, as a result of suffocation from the smoke, intense heat or noise of falling furniture.

For this reason, it is recommended to install a smoke detector in all bedrooms in the house or in the rooms. In addition, it is important to install a smoke detector in the living room, where family members stay for a long time in the winter and where heaters are usually installed.

Usually, the price of a smoke detector ranges from a few tens to hundreds of shekels, and some include a battery that lasts for 10 years. The detectors can be installed independently, according to the manufacturer's instructions.

### Owning a fire extinguisher

In addition to being able to detect the fire when it first starts and breaks out, it is important to react quickly and put out the fire as it starts. Simultaneously with the extinguishing attempts, fire and rescue should be called on [102](tel:102).

We need to make sure we can extinguish it when it breaks out. For this purpose, it is recommended to own a fire extinguisher containing 3 kg of powder, for a family home. The price of an extinguisher is about 100 ILS and it lasts for 5 years.

The extinguisher should be placed in an accessible and available place for all occupants of the house.

The powder fire extinguisher is effective against fires of solids, liquids, and electricity. The fire extinguisher suffocates the flames and prevents oxygen from reaching them, while isolating the burning material.

### How to use a fire extinguisher - pulling, adjusting, pressing

Pull the safety catch - The safety catch locks the fire extinguisher at times of routine and prevents accidental use.

Aim for the base of the flame - the mouthpiece of the fire extinguisher or pipe should be aimed at the source from which the flames come out, in order to isolate the flames from the burning material.

Pressing - Press firmly and evenly from a distance of about 2 meters, until the combustion center is fully covered.

Please note: The combination of smoke detectors with the use of a fire extinguisher allows you to respond quickly and efficiently in a way that allows you to put out the vast majority of fires in your home.

### Fire safety in the home

Avoid Keeping flammable liquids at home. If it is necessary to keep flammable material, store it in a protected place away from heat sources.

Candles are one of the most common causes of fires. Therefore, candles should be lit at home only in a candlestick designed for this, on a solid and non-flammable surface and away from an open window or curtain.

It is better to install a butterfly lock on the front door - this simple operation saves the search for the keys during an emergency and ensures a quick escape from the house in the event of a fire or danger.

When using home appliances, for example charging mobile phones, heating the house in winter, cooking in the kitchen or using air conditioners and tumble dryers - it is important to follow safety guidelines. [For details on the safety guidelines during the use of electrical appliances, follow this link.](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/articles/fires-storms/fires/2905/)

Playing with fire - Explain to your children the dangers in playing with fire, and keep matches and lighters out of their reach. [In this link you can find important points on fire safety with children and preparing children to deal with fire.](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/articles/fires-storms/fires/2905/#מכשירי חשמל ביתיים - נוח ויעיל אבל גם מסוכן)

### Performing routine exercises

Similar to how to practice entering the protected room while receiving an alert - it is also important to practice how to get out of the house in the fastest and safest way during a fire. It is important to remember: during a fire, smoke endangers us more than the fire itself, and will affect us long before we are exposed to flames.

During the exercises, pay attention to the following emphases:• Plan the quickest and safest way out, clearing it of obstacles and flammable materials.• It is recommended to practice leaving the house with all residents, including pets.• Most fires break out at night, while members of the household are asleep. It is therefore advisable to do the practice when the house is completely dark and start from the bedrooms.• During a fire, heat and smoke rise while the cleanest air remains close to the floor. Therefore, stay as close to the ground as possible.

### Call fire and rescue on 102

If you feel that you cannot put out the fire safely or that it is too big, immediately move away from the fire to a safe place and call fire and rescue on [102](tel:102) as soon as possible.

In the conversation, give the following details:• Address.• What happened or what you see.• Who was injured.• Is there danger to human lives.For more information on ways to prevent fires and deal with them visit [National Fire and Rescue Authority](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/informationtype/?OfficeId=182e15d2-c8d7-403f-9f30-b3e4df8e5e68&topic=e66ebf32-2832-4d77-9440-0d8341a8bcb9&skip=0&limit=10).
