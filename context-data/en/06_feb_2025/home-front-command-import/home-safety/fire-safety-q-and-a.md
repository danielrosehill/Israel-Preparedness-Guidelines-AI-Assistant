## What is the main cause of fires?

Fire flare-up and spread results from the encounter between a flammable substance with heat and oxygen. The main reason for fires in Israel is negligence. For instance, fires that were not properly extinguished and left with burning embers, sparks flying from welding work, or burning trimmed foliage without adhering to safety rules. The combination of these factors with drought and strong winds conditions can lead the fire to spread to nearby groves or wild plants and cause a fire that is difficult to control.

## How can I prepare my home for a fire?
Plan escape routes in advance for an event of fire, and make sure they are free of hazards and flammable materials.

## What is important to know when using electrical appliances in order to reduce the risk of fire?
Do not use an electrical appliance that has a worn or cracked cable, or when the cable heats up after switching the device on.

## What should I do during a fire?
If the exit route is clear, get out immediately and call the Israel Fire and Rescue Services, at 102. As you exit the burning apartment, close the front door but do not lock it. If going outside is not possible, gather the entire family in a place where you can breathe clean air. Do not jump from a high floor, call for help and wait for the firefighters' arrival. Once you leave the building, remain outside. Do not return to the building in any case, and do not leave the area - the information you have can be very important to the firefighters.

## What are the guidelines if I am trapped inside a house that has caught fire?
Call the Israel Fire and Rescue Services on 102. Walk keeping a low posture (the smoke rises), or crawl under the layer of smoke near the floor and along the wall and look for the nearest exit. If you cannot get out, go into the closest room, close the door and open a window to let fresh air in. Reach a window and call for help, shouting and waving a white or colorful sheet and wait for the rescue forces. Under no circumstances should you go down a smoky stairwell or use the elevator.
