When receiving an alert on the infiltration of an aerial vehicle,enter a protected space and stay inside 10 minutes, unless an additional alert was given, according to the following guidelines:

## Indoors

Enter the protected space in accordance to the protection available around you, based on the following priorities:

• **MAMAD (residential protected room), MAMAK (communal protected space), MAMAM (institutional protected space), or a shelter** – close the door by turning the handle 90 degrees and make sure the external steel window and the inner glass window are closed

• **Inner stairwell** – with no windows, openings or external walls. Sit on the stairs and don't stay in the floor space. In a building with more than three floors, stay in a stairwell with at least two floors above it. In a building with less than three floors, stay in the middle floor.

• **Inner room** – with as few external walls, windows and openings as possible. Sit in an inner corner under the window line and not facing the door. A kitchen, a bathroom or a toilet cannot be used as an inner room.

## Outdoors**

• **In a built-up area** – enter a shelter or a staircase of a nearby building. Do not stay in the entrance floor.

• **In an open area** – lie on the ground and protect your head with your hands.

## In a vehicle**

• Stop at the side of the road, exit the car and enter a shelter or a stairwell of a nearby building.

• If you cannot reach a building – exit the car and move away from the vehicle, beyond the side of the road or separation fence, lie on the ground and protect your head with your hands.

• Only if you cannot get out of the vehicle, stop at the side of the road and bend below the window line.

## On public transport**

• **On an intercity bus and on student transportation** - The driver should stop at the side of the road and open the doors, and passengers must bend below the window line and protect their heads with their hands.

• **On a city bus** - The driver should stop on the side of the road and open the doors for the passengers to safely get off and enter a nearby building. If it is not possible to reach a building within the time available to reach shelter, bend below the window line and protect your heads with your hands.

## Important highlights
• Due to the fear of a hostile aerial vehicle infiltrating the Israeli airspace, stay in the protected space for 10 minutes, unless you receive another alert or guideline.

• Do not gather in the area of the event.

• If you are in a light-construction building without access to a protected space, or a concrete or block structure you can reach within the time available to reach shelter - get out of the building, lie on the ground and protect your head with your hands.

• Contact with ammunition may cause it to ignite and endanger your life. If you have identified suspicious objects: move away from the area, keep people away and report to the Israel Police by calling 100 as soon as possible.

• The security forces are handling the incident.

• Stay updated by following the Home Front Command's messages, published on the official platforms and media channels.
