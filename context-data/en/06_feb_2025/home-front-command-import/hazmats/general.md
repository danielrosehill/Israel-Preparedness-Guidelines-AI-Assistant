## This is How We Can Prepare Children for Dealing with a Hazardous Materials Events
A family discussion about the dangers of hazardous materials and how to cope in case of a disaster will improve your ability to cope. Here are some tips on holding such a discussion
Hazardous materials can be found in our environment and that of our children. For example, cooking gas or pesticides. These substances are tagged and labelled with warning symbols, but if you do not explain them properly to your children, they may pose a danger to them.

It is critically important to hold a family discussion on the topic to allow better coping in case of a disaster. In this discussion, you should explain the dangers and risks and most of all, to emphasize how to prevent disaster, as well as Life-saving Guidelines for Hazardous Materials events. These are some tips on holding this discussion.


## What dangerous things are around me?
We recommend discussing the topic of hazardous materials with children, in relation to a specific context. Such as a recent event that occurred in Israel or around the world, a television program, a lesson they learned in school, or a movie you’ve seen.

It’s best to hold the discussion in your familiar environment, and explain to your children what are hazardous materials, such as pesticides, cleaning products, cosmetics, and the like, and what do the different symbols on them mean.

You should also teach them, in the form of a game, what is the difference between a poisonous material and an explosive one, both in terms of their warning symbols and in terms of the damage and the danger that may occur as a result of improper use. It’s a good idea to extend the discussion to the street and teach them to be aware of their environment. For example, you can explain to them about gas cylinders in your area, or about trucks that transport hazardous materials. Also emphasize to the children that the warning symbols on products, like street signs, are intended to let you know how to act and what to pay attention to.

During the discussion, it’s important to emphasize that people have the ability to prevent failures involving hazardous materials. For example: it’s best to avoid touching bottles and containers if you don’t know what’s inside. It’s also important that they know the telephone numbers of emergency services, in case of an incident involving hazardous materials.
If your children are older, you can talk to them about factories in your area, and the role hazardous materials play in those factories. Examples include ammonia, which is used for cooling of various products.

If, heaven forbid, a major events involving hazardous materials occurs - such as, for example, a failure at a factory, or an overturned truck - you need to listen to the guidelines and explain them to your children. In such a case, you may need to isolate yourselves in your home until the danger passes, or to evacuate. Depending on the type of substance and on the scenario of theevents. That’s why it’s very important to listen to guidelines- they save lives.
