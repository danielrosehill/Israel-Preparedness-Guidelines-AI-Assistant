## How can you tell an earthquake is taking place?
 
The signs indicating an earthquake has started include the floor shaking and the window panes rattling in their frames, difficulty to stand steadily and a possible feeling of slight dizziness, lamps swinging from the ceiling and objects shaking, sliding across surfaces or falling down. In addition, the National Emergency Authority, in collaboration with the Geological Survey of Israel, has installed a seismic network that enables identifying an earthquake as it starts. This network was connected to the Home Front Command's system to provide the public with earthquake alerts. The alert is a definite indicator an earthquake that endangers us is in progress in our area and we must act to protect ourselves and others - a potentially life-saving advantage.

## What should you do if an earthquake alert is received during a missile or rocket attack?
If an earthquake alert is received or if an earthquake is felt during a a rocket or missile attack, do the following:

If you can leave the building within seconds, exit and move away from the building, lie on the ground and protect your head with your hands.

If you cannot leave the building within seconds, go into the residential protected room (MAMAD), which provides a response both in the case of an earthquake and a rocket or missile attack. Once inside the MAMAD, close the window, leave the door open, and do not stand or sit across from the door.

If a MAMAD is not available, go to the stairwell.

Only if this is not possible, go into an internal room and sit in an internal corner of the room while protecting your head with your hands.

## What should you do if an earthquake occurs while you are inside a building?
If you are inside a building during an earthquake and can leave it within a few seconds - go outdoors. If you cannot exit the building immediately, quickly go to the residential protected room (MAMAD) and leave the room's window and door open. In the absence of a MAMAD, go to the stairwell and, if it is possible, descend down the stairs to the building's exit (do not use the elevator). Only if this is not possible, take cover in an internal corner in the room or under a heavy piece of furniture (such as a heavy table).

## Can the residential protected room provide protection during an earthquake?
Yes. If the building's apartments have residential protected rooms (MAMADs) , then the building is considered to be reinforced for earthquakes, in addition to providing a defensive solution for the rocket and missile threat. If you cannot immediately exit the building, go into the MAMAD as quickly as you can, leaving its door open.
