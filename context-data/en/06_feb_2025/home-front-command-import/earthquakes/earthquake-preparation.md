An earthquake is [expected to hit Israel](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/articles/earthquake/preparation-coping/2501/), but it is not known when and how powerful. The earthquake cannot be prevented, but we can minimize the number of casualties, because the quake itself does not endanger us, but the objects and structures in our environment that could collapse and hurt us.

Experience from earthquakes around the world proves that when the population is taking action and [knows the guidelines of proper behavior](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/life-saving-guidelines/earthquake/), the number of fatalities and casualties is significantly reduced. That's why it's important to be prepared today.

In order for us to deal with an earthquake situation, it's important to take 3 precautionary steps today:

1. **Familiarizing with the behavior guidelines.**2. **Preparing our home.**3. **Preparing the family.**

### The following is the description of the steps:

**1\. Familiarizing with the behavior guidelines.**

When receiving an earthquake alert, follow in accordance with the life-saving guidelines and move to a safe place, depending on where we stay - indoors, outdoors, in a vehicle or at the beach.

**2\. Preparing our home**

Many deaths during earthquakes are caused due to shelves and heavy objects collapsing, broken glass, fires and gas leaks. Therefore, it is advisable to perform the following actions today:

• Locate the safest place we can reach during an earthquake - for example, an open area in a detached house or ground floor apartment, protected room, or stairwell in a high-rise building.

\* Make sure it is free for passage and that there are no objects on the way that may fall or interfere with movement.

• Heavy objects should be placed in low places.

• Make sure there are no heavy shelves or objects hanging over the household beds.

• Cabinets, air conditioners, bookshelves, TVs, shelves and other objects that may fall during an earthquake should be strengthened and secured.

• The connections of solar water heaters and heating, gas cylinders, air conditioners and compressors must be strengthened.

• Hazardous and flammable materials should be stored in a locked place and away from heat source.

Preparing emergency equipment - In order to be prepared in advance for any scenario, we must prepare emergency equipment in advance that will be enough for us for a few days, store it in a bag and put it in an accessible place. [To the list of emergency equipment](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/articles/info/preparing-protected-space/1201/).

Preparing emergency methods of communication - When preparing the home and preparing the equipment required for an emergency, it is of great importance to prepare a telephone list of the emergency organizations, family members and neighbors in advance. [For the list of phones to prepare in advance](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/articles/haredim/emergency-preparedness/4506/).

**3\. Preparing the family**

In order for the entire family to be prepared for an earthquake event, it is important to have a family conversation on the subject, make sure everyone is familiar with the guidelines and [practice the guidelines](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/life-saving-guidelines/earthquake/). [For emphasis on preparing the family](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/articles/earthquake/preparation-coping/2505/).

### The importance of preparing in advance

The outcome of an earthquake depend on factors beyond our control, such as its occurrence, its intensity and the characteristics of the affected area, along with factors that do depend on us: the durability of the buildings, the population's readiness for the earthquake and proper behavior during the earthquake. Most of the damage is usually caused by the collapse of buildings, the collapse of infrastructure and the collapse of objects, fires and the leakage of hazardous materials, which occur as a result of the damage to buildings

The readiness of the state and of the citizens is of crucial importance in regards to the number of deaths and damages. When an earthquake occurs in a country where the population is not sufficiently preparing itself, it causes a catastrophic multi-casualty disaster, with a large number of deaths and destruction of living tissue for weeks and even months and years. However, when an earthquake occurs in a country where the population is ready, the damage is limited and minimal in comparison.

It should also be taken into account that the extent of the response that will be required following a strong earthquake, and the possibility of damage to traffic routes and infrastructure, may create a situation in which assistance to many places will be delayed. Therefore, for at least the first 24 to 72 hours after an earthquake, everyone will be required to do their best, and the community will have to organize and act on its own behalf until organized assistance from outside sources arrives. [Full guidelines during an earthquake](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/articles/earthquake/after-quake/2600/).

Experience shows that residents, occasional passers-by and local volunteers are the main sources of help after an earthquake, helping with locating trapped people, rescuing them from rubble, providing initial medical treatment and more.
