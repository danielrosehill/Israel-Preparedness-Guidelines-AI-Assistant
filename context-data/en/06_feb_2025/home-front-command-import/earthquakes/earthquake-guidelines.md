When receiving an alert on an Earthquake, we must act based on where we are, according to the following guidelines:

## Indoors

• **If you can leave the building within a few seconds** - go outside immediately.

• **If you cannot leave the building within a few seconds** - enter the protected room and leave the doorand window open.

• **If you do not have a protected room (Mamad)** - go out to the stairwell, and if possible, continue downuntil you exit the building. Do not use the elevator.

• **Only if you cannot follow the above** - sit in the inner corner of the room or under heavy furniture and protect your head with your hands.

## Outdoors
• Stay out in the open and away from building, trees and electric cables and items that might fall and risk your lives.

## Vehicle

**In a vehicle**

• Immediately stop at the side of the road and wait inside the vehicle until the earthquake is over – the vehicle protects you.

• Avoid stopping under a bridge, on an intersection, near buildings or under a steep slope for fear of collapsing, and distance yourself from it by car or on foot.

• Use signs indicating the direction of the escape routes to the marked gathering areas.

## Close To The Beach

**Close to the beach**

• Stay at least one kilometer away from the beach or go up to a fourth floor or higher, for fear of a Tsunami flooding the beach.

• Use signs indicating the direction of the escape routes to the marked gathering areas.
